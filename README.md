## Project Description
This project aims to identify the best-performing model for brain tumor detection by comparing the performance of various state-of-the-art deep learning models. The models are trained and evaluated on MRI images to detect the presence of brain tumors.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
    cd brain-tumor-detection
    ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage Guide
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:
    ```bash
    mkdir ~/.kaggle
    cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
    chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
    kaggle datasets download -d ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection --unzip
    ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook BTD_Model_Comparison.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the models.
